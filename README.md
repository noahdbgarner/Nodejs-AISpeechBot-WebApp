# Node.js server w/ Speechbot API
This project will eventually convert a users voice to
text using Dialogflow API by google.
It will take the text, process it after training
via customized agents on the google api, and
return a semi-intelligent response
with sentiment analysis.

## Future Prospects
Connecting the backend Speech API to a
e-commerce front end where users will be able
to order anything they want from the website,
and then the API will grab 3 items it 'thinks' relate to the
users request, and it will vocalize the result.
The user can say 1, 2 ,3 or yes/no to add items
to their cart etc.. more coming.
